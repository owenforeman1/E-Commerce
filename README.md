# E-Commerce

## Description

This project needed the backend made for an e-commerce site. I wanted to make the database interactive so I connected the backend and made it easy to add, update and delete products. As well as categories and tags for products. This uses express.js and sequalize to interact with the database. I learned a lot on how to use sequalize and got a better understanding of how to interact with a database.
